# COVID-19-Dashboard

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) that poses a severe threat to public health worldwide. It is
also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 

I've craeted a dashbaord using Tableau to show the current situation of COVID-19 worldwide. The dataset is downloaded from WHO COVID-19 data. It can be accessed from here:

# Functionality: 

1. The global map shows the new cases and new deaths for each country.
2. All visuals can be filtered for different country by selcting a particular country in the map.
3. All bar graphs can be filtered for daily change and cumulative change with time. 
4. First two bar graphs shows confirmed cases and deaths for countries over time.
5. The last two bar graph shows the confirmed cases and deaths for WHO regions over time.
